      "overview": "The mysterious Jay Gatsby embodies the American notion that it is possible to redefine oneself and persuade the world to accept that definition. Gatsby's youthful neighbor, Nick Carraway, fascinated with the display of enormous wealth in which Gatsby revels, finds himself swept up in the lavish lifestyle of Long Island society during the Jazz Age. Considered Fitzgerald's best work, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is a mystical, timeless story of integrity and cruelty, vision and despair.\n\n                        <p>The timeless story of Jay Gatsby and his love for Daisy Buchanan is widely acknowledged to be the closest thing to the Great American Novel ever written.\n</p>",

      "overview": "<p class=\"null1\">\"This is not a book about charismatic visionary leaders. It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor even is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary <i>companies.</i>\" So write James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time.</p>\n<p class=\"null1\">Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies — they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 — and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day — as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: <i>\"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\"</i></p>\n<p class=\"null1\">What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter &amp; Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant inanything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell-Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company — what did Boeing have that McDonnell-Douglas lacked?</p>\n<p class=\"null1\">By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished outstanding companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies.</p>\n<p class=\"null1\">Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, <i>Built to Last</i> provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.</p>\n\n\n                        <p>Fundamentally altering the way the executives think about long-term success, <i>Built to Last</i> has become a bible among CEOs and managers at prestigious corporations the world over.\n</p>",

      "overview": "\"In 1910, New York City was bursting at the seams as more and more people crowded into a limited supply of housing in the tenement districts of Manhattan and the older areas of Brooklyn. Traffic could scarcely move on the narrow streets and passengers jammed into the subways like sardines. The Lower East Side of Manhattan had the highest population density in the world. Conditions in the tenements were horrendous, as documented by the photography of Jacob Riis. Crime rates were on the rise, and the effects of overcrowding posed a serious threat to public health.\" \"With no outlet for its exploding population, and the burgeoning social problems created by the overwhelming congestion, New York faced a serious crisis which city and state leaders addressed with dramatic measures. In March 1913, public officials and officers of the two existing rapid transit networks shook hands to seal a deal for a greatly expanded subway system which would more than double the size of the two existing transit networks. Funded by both the public and private sectors, with almost all of the new lines owned by the City of New York, the Dual System of Rapid Transit would serve as a catalyst for the development of large areas of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn, permanently transforming the city's physical infrastructure and composition. The new subways also fostered the growth of Midtown Manhattan as the nation's largest business center.\" \"At the time the largest and most expensive single municipal project ever attempted, the Dual System of Rapid Transit set the pattern of growth in New York City for decades to come, helped provide millions of families a better quality of life, and, in the words of Manhattan borough president George McAneny (1910-1913), \"proved the city's physical salvation.\" It stands as that rare success story, an enormously complicated project undertaken against great odds which proved successful beyond all measure.\" \"Published in conjunction with the History of the C",
